# 🐳 Docker Compose Management Repository

Welcome to my personal Docker Compose playground! 🎉 This repo provides a set of Docker Compose configurations, environment file templates, and management scripts to deploy and manage various services using Docker. It’s designed to simplify the setup, maintenance, and management of multiple Docker services with a single, centralized workflow… mostly just for me, but feel free to poke around! 😄

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`.scripts/`**: Contains handy scripts to manage Docker Compose services and create environment file symlinks:
  - **`create_env_symlinks.sh`**: 🪄 Creates symlinks for `default.env` in each service directory.
  - **`manage-services.sh`**: 🧰 Manage Docker Compose services (launch, restart, pull, shutdown, and clean).
  - **`run_list.example`**: 📝 Example file listing services to include when running `manage-services.sh`.
  - **`run_all_except_list.example`**: 🚫 Example file listing services to exclude when running `manage-services.sh`.

- **Service Directories**: Each directory (like `cloudflare-ddns`, `frigate`, `plex`) contains:
  - **`compose.yaml`**: ⚙️ Docker Compose file for the service.
  - **`default.env`**: 🔗 Symlink to the shared `default.env` file in the root directory. (Generated by `create_env_symlinks.sh`, not included in the repo).
  - **`*.env.example`**: 🌱 Example environment files for service-specific configurations.

- **`default.env`**: 🌍 Template environment file used as a base configuration for all services.  
  *(Not included in the repo. Copy `default.env.example` and create it yourself.)*
- **`default.env.example`**: ✨ Example of the base environment configuration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) 🐳 and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/treysullivent/docker-compose.git
   cd docker-compose
   ```

2. **Create Environment Files**:
   - Run the `create_env_symlinks.sh` script to create symlinks for `default.env` in each service directory:
     ```sh
     .scripts/create_env_symlinks.sh
     ```

   - For services requiring additional environment variables, copy the example `.env.example` files and fill in the values:
     ```sh
     cp cloudflare-ddns/cloudflare.env.example cloudflare-ddns/cloudflare.env
     # Repeat for other services as needed
     ```

3. **Configure the Run List**:
   - Edit `run_list` or `run_all_except_list` in the `.scripts` directory to specify which services to include or exclude when running `manage-services.sh`.
     - **`run_list`**: List of services to run. Leave empty to run all services.
     - **`run_all_except_list`**: List of services to exclude. Leave empty to run all services.

4. **Manage Services**:
   - Use the `manage-services.sh` script to manage your Docker Compose services:
     ```sh
     .scripts/manage-services.sh --launch
     ```
   - Other options include:
     - `--restart`: Restart services 🔄
     - `--pull`: Pull the latest Docker images ⬇️
     - `--shutdown`: Shutdown services 🛑
     - `--clean`: Prune all unused Docker objects 🧹

## 🎨 Customization

- **Environment Files**: Customize the `default.env` and other `.env` files to fit your specific environment and service needs.
- **Compose Files**: Tweak `compose.yaml` files in each service directory to adjust Docker Compose configurations like ports, volumes, and network settings.

## 💡 Example Usage

1. **Launch All Services**:
   ```sh
   .scripts/manage-services.sh --launch
   ```

2. **Restart Specific Services**:
   ```sh
   echo -e "cloudflare-ddns\nfrigate" > .scripts/run_list
   .scripts/manage-services.sh --restart
   ```

3. **Pull Latest Images and Launch Services Except Specific Ones**:
   ```sh
   echo -e "plex\nyoutube-dl" > .scripts/run_all_except_list
   .scripts/manage-services.sh --pull --launch
   ```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Missing Environment Files**: Make sure all necessary `.env` files are created and filled out correctly.
- **Permission Issues**: Check that Docker has the correct permissions to access directories and files specified in `compose.yaml`.
- **Service Logs**: View logs for specific services using:
  ```sh
  docker compose -f <service-directory>/compose.yaml logs
  ```
